For this project, my interest was to take these average book ratings and the decades they were published. By turning these datasets into a graph, it is easy to see the general opinion on books.

My favorite part about this assignment is how anyone can drum up a reason for book ratings spiking or decreasing. Afterwards, we can talk about it and discuss other factors. Through this process, we open up a healthy channel of communication about various cultural aspects

To utilize the script, the following Libraries are required:

I also want to comment on the last markdown I made. Throughout highschool, I only read the books that were required. In college, I have made an increased effort to read and have loved every moment of it. The possibility that ratings will stagnate because Gen-z doesn't read is quite disheartening and I hope we can start a wave of readers!!
