This is a simple program that will prompt you for a favorite food
Afterwards, it'll ask you where you enjoy it typically, home or restaurant
Finally, it'll ask you for a side/drink that goes with it

After entering these points, it will print the data and ask if it is correct. Input 'y' to proceed.
If you input y, the data will be written to a text file called favoritefood.txt

If you would like to repeat the function type 'y' again
To leave the function, simply input anything else
