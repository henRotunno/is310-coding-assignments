I selected the Spongebob fandom because I have incredibly familar with it's characters and episodes. The show is also massive and has a lot of data that can be used. 

I would like to scrape the seasons of the episodes and see how many of the characters appear in the description. This is important because the characters in Spongebob have defined personalities that determine the lesson of the episode. For example: an episode such as "Arrgh!" is described as "Mr. Krabs takes Spongebob and Patrick to go on a treasure hunt." From this description we can see how promiment the characters are and predict the lesson of the story: Mr. Krabs is probably disregarding Spongebob and Patrick to be cheap.

In addition, I think it would be interesting to see the popularity of the characters. Everyone knows Spongebob, but what about Pearl and Karen?
