I selected the Spongebob fandom because I have incredibly familar with it's characters and episodes. The show is also massive and has a lot of data that can be used. 

I would like to scrape the seasons of the episodes and see how many of the characters appear in the description. This is important because the characters in Spongebob have defined personalities that determine the lesson of the episode. For example: an episode such as "Arrgh!" is described as "Mr. Krabs takes Spongebob and Patrick to go on a treasure hunt." From this description we can see how promiment the characters are and predict the lesson of the story: Mr. Krabs is probably disregarding Spongebob and Patrick to be cheap. 

In addition, I think it would be interesting to see the popularity of the characters. Everyone knows Spongebob, but what about Pearl and Karen? Funnily enough, Wendy's just released a Krabby Patty Meal which demonstrates the advertising potential of this franchise. Some characters/aspects are pushed more than others by Nickelodeon in regard to advertising. When I scraped the website, I was surprised to see Patrick have signifcantly more mentions than Squidward who seems to always be involved in Spongebob's antics to the dismay of Squiddy. 

Seeing all of these variables laid out in a nice format got me to think about the show and think about what episodes were the most memorable. Of course, they where the ones with the most popular characters. However, there are a lot of memorable lines/moments from episodes by characters that are less known. If I had to guess, these characters are in the show sparingly to keep the niche or joke they provide from getting stale. You can only make so many Bubble Bass pickle jokes before the joke runs it's course and the audience grows frusterated.

Thank you for reading this unnecessarily large text where I yap about spongebob :)
